# Voting App

## Project Overview
The Voting App is a simple web application that allows users to vote for different options. Built with Node.js and Express, the application features an API that manages voting options and the votes they receive. Users can retrieve the current voting options and submit their votes via HTTP requests.

## Installation
To run the Voting App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd voting-app
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To start the Voting App, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start, and you can access the app at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### API Endpoints
- **GET /api/options**: Retrieves the current voting options and their respective vote counts.
- **POST /api/vote**: Submits a vote for a specific option. The request body should contain the `optionId` of the option being voted for, in JSON format, e.g.:
  ```json
  {
    "optionId": 1
  }
  ```

## Features
- Retrieve voting options and their current votes.
- Vote for your favorite option.
- Invalid votes are handled gracefully with error messages.

- `express`: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
- `path`: Built-in Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
